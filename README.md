# Hello And Welcome To Vend-O-Matic
Did a pivot from using Flask to using Django for a Vending Machine REST API challenge

Let's get started

## Launching The App

Let's get the app set up first.

1. Clone the git repository
```
git clone git@github.com:kellycook301/vendoMANIAC.git
```

2. Install Django REST Framework
```
pipenv install djangorestframework
```

3. Launch virtual environment
```
pipenv shell
```

4. Run server
```
python manage.py runserver
```

Check out the API Root by navigating to this.
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

### Take-Away

Firstly, I want to thank the folks at Campaign Monitor/Emma for giving me the opportunity to try my hand at this take-home coding challenge. It certainly did get my brain going. Unfortunately, I did not complete all that I wanted to with the challenge. That being said, I still wanted to submit my progress and show my work because I feel there is value in that. I also did learn QUITE a lot during the process. But first, I’d like to give an overview of what I did. 

Prior to speaking with Joe Biggert, I was taking a look at some material online covering Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, and Marshmallow. I wanted to better familiarize myself with more of the technology that Campaign Monitor uses. Upon receiving the challenge, I noticed that perhaps Flask could be used in setting up a REST API for the vending machine. I did some initial planning by writing out what I believed was needed to accomplish the task. There was some trial and error getting the REST API set up, but I felt like I got it to where it could be a good jumping-off point for the next steps. The older repo is available here for reference...([first attempt](https://github.com/kellycook301/vendomatic))

About halfway through Thursday I started to feel a little stuck and felt like I was spinning my wheels a bit. I then remembered the job posting on the Campaign Monitor website. Flask was one framework mentioned, but I did not take into account that pivoting could still be a viable option. I did some research on the Django website and found plenty of video and forum resources online for reference.

I may not have completed the challenge in its entirety, but if there is one thing I will say, it’s that I did not give up and I found a way to pivot to learn something new and get out of a rut. I have a great passion for learning, overcoming obstacles, and finding a place where I can grow and better sharpen my skillset. I know that given the opportunity, I would be a great asset to the team. Should there be an opportunity to talk about this more in-depth, I would be ecstatic to do so.

Best,

Kelly Cook
